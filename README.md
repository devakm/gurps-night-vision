# gurps-night-vision
Night Vision for GURPS Game Aid (GGA). 

FVTT/GGA implementation of the Night Vision advantage, based on a Warhammer mod by TheFirst05, with permission.

This module partially automates the Night Vision talent in the gurps system. The effective dim illumination radius of all light sources is extended for a selected token with the Night Vision talent or trait.

Night Vision does not let you see in complete darkness, it just makes light sources illuminate a larger area. I recommend setting the token sight range to 1 grid unit, but feel free to use whatever you prefer. GURPS is all about playing the way you like to play.

The inspiration for this module is that in GURPS RAW Night Vision has no effect in areas that are completely dark, but if there is even a small amount of light then Night Vision reduces the penalties by -1 per level. 

How would this work visually in a VTT like Foundry? 

One typical solution is to just assign a vision range to the token, but even assigning a sight range based on Night Vision level felt awkward to me. It renders moot the practical difference between a 1-point advantage like Night Vision and a 25-point advantage like Dark Vision. 

I wanted to see a difference between Night Vision 3 and Night Vision 9 represented visually in-game. Increasing the radius of light sources for tokens that have Night Vision seems like the only way to approximate it.

Note that light sources like torches or candles don't illuminate much area, so in a large open area of a map with no ambient light there will still be areas with complete darkness.
