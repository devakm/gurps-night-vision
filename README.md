# gurps-night-vision
Night Vision for GURPS Game Aid (GGA). 

FVTT/GGA implementation of the Night Vision advantage, based on a Warhammer mod by TheFirst05, with permission.

This module partially automates the Night Vision talent in the gurps system. The effective dim illumination radius of all light sources is extended for a selected token with the Night Vision talent or trait.

Night Vision does not let you see in complete darkness, it just makes light sources illuminate a larger area. 

I recommend setting the token Vision Range of all tokens whose vision is affected by light sources to 1 or 0 grid unit. Otherwise, Night Vision becomes largely meaningless. However, feel free to use whatever settings you prefer. GURPS is all about playing the way you like to play.

## Changelog
- 1.3.0 adds support for Dark Vision, letting you see through Darkness and avoid the Foundry default Blindness condition when entering a Darkness area, if you have the Dark Vision advantage or spell active. 
- 1.3.1 adds a compendium called **SpellEffects**. It contains two folders: **Player Macros** and **GM Macros**. See [here](https://github.com/devakm/gurps-night-vision/wiki#compendium-macros) for details.
